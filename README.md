👩🏼Micaela's Profile

I was born in Argentina, grew up there too, went to nursing school with the main goal to learn how to help others and with that tool I got to travel the world thanks to volunteering. I love to read, play the piano and knowing new cultures. Currently, I am working as a FullStack Developer.

💻I am passionate about technology and how it can improve our ability to reach better humanity, altough ironic I think is possible. At the moment I am skilled in frontend and backend languages such as HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, AJAX, Ruby on Rails and SQL. One of the things I admire about proffesionals in this area is that YOU NEVER STOP LEARNING and that is exciting in deed.

In the near future I would enjoy applying human-centered design and design thinking principles to create innovative solutions and business models geared towards growth.

I looove selling others, I hate selling myself. So there it is. Have a nice day! 🎈
